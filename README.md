# DHMO Destroyer
DHMO Destroyer is an Arduino based remote control boat with an Android app as the controller.

The Android controller app was built using Kotlin and it sent serial data to the Arduino Uno board situated on top of the DHMO Destroyer. The Arduino took in this serial data, and converted into commands which controlled two DC motors which powered the propellors and one servo motor which controlled the rudder.
